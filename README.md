# Rivers
This repository contains CliMA's River models.

For the models forecasting streamflow on independent catchments, see `examples/catchment_models`. This part supports our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14212).

For the models forecasting streamflow considering routing, see `examples/routing_models`.
